# Admin Console

The [Admin Console](https://admin.passwordless.dev/) is your primary GUI for creating and configuring applications, monitoring application usage, and managing billing:

Once you create a new application, you'll have a handful of pages available to you.

- [Applications](./admin-console/applications.md)
- [Billing](./admin-console/billing.md)
- [Admins](./admin-console/admins.md)
