# Admins

The **Admins** page allows you to invite other administrators to your Passwordless.dev organization to manage applications, billing, and more. All admins, including whomever created the Passwordless.dev account and any applications, have **equal permissions within the organization**.

To invite an admin:

1. Enter an email address in the **Invitees** text input and select **Send Invite**.
2. Your future-admin will receive an invite email. Instruct them to use this invite to complete registration for Passwordless.dev and, subsequently, to follow the email verification step.

Admins can be deleted from this same page.

:::warning
Due to all admins having equal permissions within the organization, it is currently possible for a newly-invited admin to delete a previously-provisioned admin from the organization.
